The Indus Hospital Database SQL Project demonstrates the effective use of SQL to manage, analyze, and extract meaningful insights from healthcare data. 
This project focuses on building and querying a hospital database to facilitate data-driven decisions and enhance operational efficiency.


Project Highlights:

Comprehensive Patient and Doctor Analysis:

   Identified doctors treating specific illnesses (e.g., diabetes and anemia).
   Retrieved patient details, including contact information, diagnoses, and prescribed medications.
   
Operational and Financial Insights:

    Calculated total salary expenditures for hospital workers.
    Analyzed cafeteria operations, staff assignments, and food services.

Advanced Querying Techniques:

    Joined multiple tables to retrieve relevant healthcare insights, including patient diagnosis, prescribed medications, and doctor qualifications.
    Incorporated left joins to show comprehensive patient details, even when no medications were prescribed.

Performance Metrics:

   Found the average age of patients diagnosed with specific illnesses (e.g., flu).
   Retrieved staff job titles and their assigned roles in the cafeteria.

Key SQL Skills Demonstrated:
   Advanced JOINs (INNER, LEFT)
   Aggregate functions (e.g., SUM, AVG)
   Filtering and conditions using WHERE clauses
   Data analysis and reporting for healthcare use cases

Value Added:

This project showcases the ability to manage complex healthcare databases, extract actionable insights, and support hospital operations with data-driven solutions. It is a step toward enhancing healthcare management through SQL expertise.
